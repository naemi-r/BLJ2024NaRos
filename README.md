## About me
My name is Naemi and I am 16 years old. <br>
I am currently in my first year of apprenticeship at Kyndryl, where I am training to become a platform developer.<br>
I live in Einsiedeln, a beautiful place that I call home. In my free time, I enjoy reading and staying active through various sports. <br>
These hobbies keep me balanced and energized as I pursue my career in technology.
